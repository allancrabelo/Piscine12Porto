# 🏊 Piscine 42 — A Life-Changing Immersive Experience

## 📘 Overview
The 42 Piscine is a 28-day intensive immersion program designed as the initial and most challenging selection phase of the prestigious École 42 — a tuition-free, teacherless, peer-to-peer coding school with a project-based methodology.

This program challenges candidates to solve real-world programming problems under pressure, collaborate in teams, and build everything from scratch. It's not just about learning how to code — it’s about proving your ability to learn independently, adapt quickly, and persist through adversity.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Piscine
To evaluate candidates' technical growth, logical reasoning, autonomy, and collaboration, in a fast-paced environment that reflects the realities of working at top tech companies — intense, dynamic, and team-driven.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools
Core Language: `C (ANSI C standard)`

Environment: `Linux (Ubuntu)`, `Bash terminal`, `VSCode`, `GIT`

Tools: `gc`c, `make`, `vim`, `git`, `norminette` (42's code style checker)

📂 Technical Structure
The Piscine revolves around a progressive list of C exercises, each designed to develop a specific core concept. These challenges strengthen fundamental programming skills — from basic syntax to advanced memory manipulation using pointers and dynamic allocation.

### 🔹 C Exercise Lists

## 📊 Evaluation System
- Peer evaluations: Projects are reviewed by fellow candidates to encourage code reading and feedback exchange.

- Weekly exams: Time-limited 4-hour exams simulate high-pressure technical interviews.

- Grading criteria: Automated tests, code style (norminette), and feature completeness.

## 💼 Key Competencies Gained
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving

- Time management and pressure handling

- Technical communication and peer feedback

- Adaptability and self-learning

- Teamwork in collaborative coding environments

## 🧠 The 42 Method
- "We don’t teach. We create the conditions for you to teach yourself — with others."

- Peer-to-peer learning: No teachers. Students help and evaluate each other.

- Gamified progression: Projects, levels, and experience points replace traditional grades.

- Hands-on education: Every challenge involves active research, implementation, and debugging.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts
Participating in the 42 Piscine was a transformative experience. In just four weeks, I gained a depth of programming knowledge and problem-solving resilience that often takes years to develop. This journey not only solidified my foundation in C and algorithms but also shaped me into a more autonomous, collaborative, and focused developer — ready to take on real-world challenges.
